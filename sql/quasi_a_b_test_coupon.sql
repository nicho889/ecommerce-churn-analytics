   A_B_TEST_COUPON.SQL â€” Quasi A/B test: Coupon vs No Coupon
   Purpose: Measure churn & retention for coupon customers vs non-customers.
   Dataset: ecom_churn (already created in exploration.sql)
   Notes:
     - This is NOT a true randomized A/B test (customers self-select).
     - Insights are directional only.
